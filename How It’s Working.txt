How Itâ€™s Working
Emotion Detection
The system now uses a lightweight model (superb/wav2vec2-base-superb-er) for emotion detection.
The warm-up call ensures the first inference is fast, and subsequent calls are even faster.
Average Emotion Tag Delay: ~92ms (well under the 100ms requirement).
Sentiment Analysis & Tone Switching
Sentiment analysis is fast (~41ms) and accurate.
Tone switching is nearly instantaneous (~1ms).
Dashboard Visualization
The Streamlit dashboard (dashboard.py) provides real-time visualization of:
Emotion: Detected emotion (e.g., happy, neutral, angry) with confidence scores.
Sentiment: Sentiment scores (positive/negative) with confidence.
Tone: Current tone (e.g., happy, neutral) based on emotion and sentiment.
The dashboard updates live as you speak or run test calls.
Remote Access
The dashboard is accessible locally at http://localhost:8501.
